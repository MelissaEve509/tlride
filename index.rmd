# Welcome {-} 

This   is  the   website   for   __"A  Guided   Tour   in  Targeted   Learning
Territory"__. 

__Organization__

The text  takes the  form of  a series  of brief  sections. The  main sections
combine theoretical and computational developments. The code is written in the
programming language  [R](https://www.r-project.org).  R is widely  used among
statisticians and  data scientists  to develop  statistical software  and data
analysis. 

Regularly, a section  is inserted that proposes exercizes.   Each such section
is indicated by the <span style="color:red">&#9881;</span> symbol.  The symbol
<span  style="color:red">&#x2621;</span> also  indicates those  sections whose
content is more involved.

__Overview__

After a short introduction, we present the reproducible experiment that will
play a central role throughout the text. Then, we introduce the main parameter
of interest.  We  comment upon some of  its properties that are  useful from a
statistical perspective.  This paves  the way to  the presentation  of several
estimators that  are increasingly more powerful  statistically. The discussion
takes us into *targeted learning territory*.


__Audience__

The  text  might  be  of  interest  to  students  in  statistics  and  machine
learning. It might also serve as a gentle introduction to targeted learning in
both its theoretical and computational  aspects before delving deeper into the
literature [@TMLEbook11], [@TMLEbook18].

__Technical details__

The text is written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org).
