#  Welcome {-} 

This is either the  website or the text called __"A  Ride in Targeted Learning
Territory"__. In the former case, the text can be dowloaded by clicking on the
dedicated button  in the  top part  of the  webpage. In  the latter  case, the
website can be browsed [here](http://www.tlride.edu "TLRIDE").

```

__Organization__ 

The text  takes the  form of  a series  of brief  sections. The  main sections
combine theoretical and computational developments. The code is written in the
programming  language [`R`](https://www.r-project.org).   `R`  is widely  used
among statisticians  and data scientists  to develop statistical  software and
data analysis.

Regularly, a section  is inserted that proposes exercizes.   Each such section
is indicated by the  <span style="color:red">&#9881;</span> \gear symbol.  The
symbol  <span  style="color:red">&#9761;</span> \stixdanger{}  also  indicates
those sections whose content is more involved.

__Overview__

After a short introduction, we present the reproducible experiment that will
play a central role throughout the text. Then, we introduce the main parameter
of interest.  We  comment upon some of  its properties that are  useful from a
statistical perspective.  This paves  the way to  the presentation  of several
estimators that  are increasingly more powerful  statistically. The discussion
takes us into *targeted learning territory*.


__Audience__

The  text  might  be  of  interest  to  students  in  statistics  and  machine
learning. It might also serve as a gentle introduction to targeted learning in
both its theoretical and computational  aspects before delving deeper into the
literature [@TMLEbook11], [@TMLEbook18].

__Technical details__

The   text   is    written   in   [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
with         [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org).         Assuming         that
the  [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/)   package  is  installed,   you  can
retrieve all the `R` code by running

```{r extract, eval = FALSE}
knitr::purl("abcd.Rmd")
```
